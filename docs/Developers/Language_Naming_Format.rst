.. note::

    - For language naming, always consider the format that is used in the
      corresponding Wikipedia page (exception: use CPP, instead
      of cpp or c++).
    - If the definition does not exist already, a language definition
      should be added while writing a new bear.
    - The alias used in LANGUAGES should be one of the
      names in the coala definition.
